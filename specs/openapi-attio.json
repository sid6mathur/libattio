This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned. The maximum date is \"9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z\".",

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.

For example, if you want to add a reference to the person record with email \"alice@website.com\", you should pass a value with `target_object` set to `\"people\"` and `email_addresses` set to `[{email_address:\"alice@website.com\"}]`. The key should be the slug or ID of the matching attribute you would like to use and the value should be an array containing a single value of the appropriate attribute type (as specified below). Matching on multiple values is not currently supported. Matching attributes must be unique. This process is similar to how you use the `matching_attribute` query param in Attio's [assert endpoints](/rest-api/endpoint-reference/records/assert-a-record).",
